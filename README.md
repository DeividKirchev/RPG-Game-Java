# RPG Game
A RPG game, created with Java

## Game Idea
The concept of the game is a character in a **fantasy-medieval** world. The player can currently choose from 3 classes - Warrior, Mage and Hunter (Mage's and Hunter's abilities currently are unfinished), each class having it's own strong and weak sides. Each class will have it's own talent tree with different specialization. The game features items, which increase the player's stats.

## Map Generator
The project also includes a generator for the map with the basic images used in the game. The user can change the size of the map. Holding "SHIFT" enables fast-drawing mode. The map can be saved with a custom name. The created .txt file can be read and loaded by the game and can also be opened in the generator for editing.

## Backpack
The player has a backpack with all collected items. They can choose the best for their class and preference. The potions they receive can be consumed to increase the current health.

## Abilities
Each class has it's own abilities with animation on use for each one. Some of the require the player to have a target, some of them deal damage in an area etc. Each ability has a cooldown.

## NPC
The NPCs move in random paths. When they get close enough to the player they start throwing weapons dealing damage to them and when they get within 1 square they use melee attacks.
